# Spelling Tester
This small program is created to help my daughter to practice for her spelling
bee competition.

We were given a list of words with origins:

1. Arabic
2. Asian
3. Dutch
4. Eponyms
5. French
6. German
7. Greek
8. Italian
9. Japanese
10. Latin
11. New World
12. Old English
13. Slavic
14. Spanish

An origin is an attribute of a given word, and here I added another attribute
called [difficulty], which a user can set. Now a helper can generate random
words using the origin and the difficulty level. Then a helper can read the
word one by one. If I add more features later, I can host it in a website with
pronunciation as another attribute added. Then a user can self-test using this
program.

I used python with pandas.
